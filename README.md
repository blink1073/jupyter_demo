This is a proof on concept demonstration of integrating the refactoring work
on the Jupyter Notebook with Phosphor widgets.  It is not meant to be a fully
functional notebook.  Future development will occur in jupyter/notebook and 
related jupyter repositories.  Note, the demo assumes you have no other 
notebook servers running.  Enjoy!


To install:

```
npm install 
npm run build
```

Requires the development version of Jupyter Notebook:

`pip install git+https://github.com/jupyter/notebook`

To run the demo:

`python main.py`
